## Transmission post processing settings. The settings specify
## which file extensions and codecs of downloaded files are
## watched and indexed accordingly.
[Transmission]
codecs     = x264, h264, x265, h265, hevc
extensions = mkv, mp4


## Settings related to the VS-SynoIndex server
[SynoIndex]
synoindex_port = 32699

## Hostsystem related settings are necessary if the VS-Transmission script
## should run directly within the Synology DSM host system. For example if
## Transmission is installed in DSM or Synology Download-Station is used for
## downloading. If the VS-Transmission is intended to run within a docker
## container then the settings are ignored.
##
## Settings:
## - The handbrake setting specifies the path to the root handbrake directory.
## - The exclude setting allows to ignore files with a specific string in
##     the file path. For example: FuN releases are already x265 encoded.
## - The watch directories defines which directory are watched by the script
##     in case that a downloaded file is located there.
